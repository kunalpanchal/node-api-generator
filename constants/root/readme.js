A simple application made in NodeJS which scrappes shopping.com to fetch details.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

NodeJS & NPM should be installed.

### Installing and running it locally

Get up and running asap

\`\`\`
npm install
npm start
\`\`\`

Or to run it in watch mode :

\`\`\`
npm install -g node-dev
npm i
npm run thecrawler
\`\`\`

After you run, navigate to \`http://localhost:3000\` (You can change the port number in .env file)

## Deployment
